# Epub Editor

Tool I hacked up to cleaup epubs made by WebToEpub
This is very much a work in progress, and not really my best work.

## How to use
* Copy the HTML and JS files to a directory.
* Add jszip.min.js from https://stuk.github.io/jszip/ to same directory
* Open main.html in chrome.
* Drag and drop epub onto the drop zone.
* Click the "Check for Zero Size Images" button to see WebToEpub inserted "empty" images when it was unable to fetch the wanted image from the Internet.
* If it does, you can click the "Remove Zero Size Images" to correctly remove them from the epub.
